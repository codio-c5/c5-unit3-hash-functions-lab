In this lab you will verify that a file you download has not been changed during download.

1. **Go to site** https://www.openoffice.org/download/index.html. 
   - ***Note*** there two download options: “*Download full installation*” and “*Download language pack*.”
   - Because you will work only with the hash values in this exercise, please **download the smaller file** for the sake of time (i.e., download the “language pack” file).
2. Use an online hash calculator to **calculate the MD5 and SHA256 hashes for the downloaded file**. 
   - You can use https://md5file.com/calculator. 
   - Copy these values into a Word file.
   - Take a screenshot. 
3. **Go back to site** https://www.openoffice.org/download/index.html. 
   - Note that there are **links for MD5 and SHA256 hashes of the files** on the site.  
   - Click on **MD5** for Language Pack. 
   - Save it on your computer and open it with Notepad. 
   - Take a screenshot of the hash file showing the MD5 hash value.
   - Do the same for the **SHA256** hash value.
   - Compare these hash values with the ones that you calculated when you downloaded the file.
     - **Are they the same?**
